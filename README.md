## Introduction / Deployment

[Demo](https://astro-theme-pure.vercel.app/) | [Showcase](https://github.com/cworld1/astro-theme-pure/issues/10)

For more information, please visit the [CWorld Site](https://cworld0.com/blog/theme-resume) and [Deployment Instructions](https://astro-theme-pure.vercel.app/blog/customize).

## Local development

Environment requirements:

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/): 18.0.0+
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/): 1.0.0+

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cworld1/astro-theme-pure.git
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
cd astro-theme-pure
bun install
```
> [!NOTE]
> For Bun, if the installation is slow, it is recommended to use a mirror configuration by creating  `bunfig.toml` under the project root directory:
>
> ```toml
> [install]
> registry = "<npm mirror site>"
> ```
>
> For details about other PM mirror configs, you may need to see their official documents.

Start the development server:

```shell
bun dev
# For Windows, Bun has not yet implemented background tasks. So for Bun, use the following command instead:
# bun start
```

Or build (you may need to use node.js SSR firstly):

```shell
bun run build
```

Preview:

```shell
bun preview
```

## Contributions

To spend more time coding and less time fiddling with whitespace, this project uses code conventions and styles to encourage consistency. Code with a consistent style is easier (and less error-prone!) to review, maintain, and understand.
